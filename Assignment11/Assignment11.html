    Chosen by Fu as the keeper of the Ladybug Miraculous, she can transform into the valiant and vivacious superheroine "Ladybug" with the help of her kwami Tikki, to defend Paris from Hawk Moth's villains with her crime-fighting partner Cat Noir. As Ladybug, aware of the nature of the situations that she faces.Marinette's resourcefulness and her wit enable her to figure out how to use the lucky charm. The yo-yo also captures and purifies the Akuma butterflies, after which she has the created object turn into energy to summon her power, "Miraculous Ladybug", that removes the harm the villains caused and restores everything to normal.

<h2>Cat Noir</h2>
<p>
    Adrien comes from a wealthy family, and is a popular fashion model for the clothing company of his father, Gabriel, though he laments the poor relationship he has with him; his mother, meanwhile, has inexplicably disappeared. Adrien is kind, loyal, sensitive and well-liked, and hangs out often with his best friend Nino.
    Chosen by Master fu to be the keeper of the Black Cat Miraculous, he can transform into the superhero "Cat Noir" (French: Chat Noir, "black cat") with the help of his kwami Plagg to assist Ladybug in saving Paris from Hawk Moth's villains.
    His weapon that he uses to fight the villains is a multi-functional staff and his special power of destruction, "Cataclysm", allows him to destroy an object that he touches with a swipe of his paw, such as causing a metal gate to rust over until weak enough to break open.

<h2>Queen Bee</h2>
<p>
  Chloe Bouregeois is the mayor's daughter. Chloé is extremely spoiled, snobby, rude, and thinks the world revolves around her. She often bullies people, especially her classmates, primarily resulting in their sadness and despair becoming a target for Hawk Moth's transforming them into akumatized villains. 
  She has no knowledge of Ladybug's identity, and is a big fan of Ladybug, often trying to take pictures with her; she even has a Ladybug costume that she uses in private to imitate her which results in Alya believing she is the real Ladybug until she gets akumatized into Lady Wifi.
  In the season 2 episode "Style Queen", she finds the Bee Miraculous after her mother, Audrey, is restored from being Style Queen and meets its kwami of subjection Pollen, and in the next episode "Queen Wasp," becomes the bee-themed superheroine, Queen Bee. Her weapon is a spinning top and her special power, Venom, allows her to paralyze others. Her transformation call is "Pollen, Buzz On!" (French: Pollen, transforme-moi!, "Pollen, transform me!").
