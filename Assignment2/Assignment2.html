    <section><H1>Welcome to the colour_green template</H1>
    <p>Loreum Ipsum is simply a dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
         Loreum Ipsum has been the industry's satandard dummy text ever since the 1500s, whwn an unknown printer took a gallery of type
          and scrambled it to make a type of spicimen book. It has survived not only five centuries but also the 
          leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in thr 1960s with the relese of 
        Letraset sheets containing Loreum Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus Pagemaker including versions of Loreum Ipsum.
