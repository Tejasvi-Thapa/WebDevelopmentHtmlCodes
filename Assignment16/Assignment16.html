 <h3>This is about Panda</h3>
 <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo), also known as the panda bear or simply the panda, is a bear native to south central China. It is characterised by large, black patches around its eyes, over the ears, 
and across its round body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.
 Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food. </p>

    While the dragon has often served as China's national symbol, internationally the giant panda has often filled this role. As such, it is becoming widely used within China in international contexts, for example, appearing since 1982 on gold
 panda bullion coins and as one of the five Fuwa mascots of the Beijing Olympics.

 <h2 id="Facts">Important Fact</h2>
<p id="Fact1">
   The typical panda grows from 1.2 m to 1.9 m.
   Pandas are native to south-central China.
   In captivity, the average lifespan of a panda is 30 years.
   Pandas typically weigh from 70 kg to 100 kg.
   An estimated 1,864 pandas still roam the wild, while 400 are kept in captivity.
</p>
<p id="fact2">
   As adults, pandas grow big enough to prove their namesake of giant pandas. However, newborns are the complete opposite. Upon birth, baby pandas measure 900 times smaller than their mother. With the average size of 5 oz, they only weigh a mere 36 g to 210 g.
</p>
<p id="Fact3">
   Normally, the panda diet consists of 99% bamboo. Although they already eat large amounts to compensate for bamboo’s poor nutritional value, their bodies are further specialized to sustain their needs.
Despite being herbivores, pandas evolved to have a shorter gut, which is usually only seen in carnivores. The special construction of their digestive system allows pandas to metabolize all the nutrients they need to survive.
</p>
<p id="Fact4">
   Pandas may be known for their distinct black and white coloring, but they lack these colors completely at birth. Instead, newborn pandas appear mostly pink with a fine layer of hair.
Their black and white color only appears after around three weeks. Baby pandas are also born blind with weak limbs. As a result, baby pandas have to stay in their nests for two months, relying completely on their mothers for sustenance.
